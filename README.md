Build the Patterns for  BYJU'S Company for Education Purpose only. Design the workflow of each pattern in the Symbols and Numbers, Alphabets, design There is a typical structure to print any pattern, i.e., the number of rows and columns. We need to use two loops to print any pattern, i.e., use nested loops. The outer loop tells us the number of rows, and the inner loop tells us the column needed to print the pattern.Accept the number of rows from a user using the input() function to decide the size of a pattern. Manipulating the print statements, different number patterns, alphabet patterns or star patterns can be printed.  Develop a Static and Dynamic Pattern in Python and Deploy in Pypi.org, with Github.
